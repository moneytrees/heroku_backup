# plutus_sandbox

This is a just a basic file structure for development purposes. The self-signed certificate will cause a warning in your Chrome browser, unless you follow some steps to trust the certificate. The deployed version will use a certificate from a CA. You will need to make your own .env file to get the app into a testable condition. The keys and instructions will be posted on the Slack channel for the unshared files that will be needed. I haven't yet created the routes in React, but the sandbox is fully functional inside React for testing/development.
